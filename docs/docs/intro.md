# Overview

Dive deep into the me3 Protocol and add identity to your community.

## The Stack

The me3 Protocol is made up of three core parts:

* the smart contracts for subdomain registration and authorisation
* the embedable claim widget for your website
* the dapp to showcase user profiles

### Smart Contracts

Our contract documentation is under the **Contracts** menu on the left. The main contract is `Registrar.sol` and this one should be made a controller on your ENS name to work correctly.

### Embedable Claim Widget

Our claim widget is available at https://github.com/me3-eth/claim-widget along with usage examples for React, Vue, and Svelte.

### Dapp

Our dapp is hosted on IPFS and uses ENS for routing to the contenthash. We also have a centralized gateway for accessing the site.
